# BIOS Configuration

- Enable XMP to improve RAM performance. Disabling unnecessary devices: Disable devices in the BIOS that you are not using to reduce system boot time. Then go into something like Avanced BIOS Features or OC/Overclocking settings or OC Tweaker and find the settings below and disable what I personally recommend (Hyper-Threading or SMT (AMD) , P-states/ C-states or (Global C-states Control, C1E, CPU C-states) , Intel(R) Speed Shift Technology).
