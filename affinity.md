# Affinity

- Bind only to physical cores (do not touch threads!). Bind GPU + its PCI Bridge to one core, USB xHCI with mouse + its PCI slot to another. You can also experiment with the sound head (High Definition Audio) and bind it to one core, but I prefer not to touch the sound. Which cores should I choose?  ( DISCLAIMER about HT / SMT so that people do not put 2 ticks tk driver passes through the 2nd register of the stream and the latency increases). AMD: we choose cores within one CCX, never use CPU 0 and CPU 1 in Affinity. It's more profitable to use the fastest core on the first CCX (look in HWinfo for the success of cores) for USB xHCI with the mouse, and a slightly weaker core in the same CCX for the video card. Intel: there are 2 variants of kernels arrangement, check by MouseTester, TimerBench and games what kernels are more favorable to use in your case. FACT: it is better to hang on the cores that are closer to the memory controller. Check bindings with InterruptChecker.
